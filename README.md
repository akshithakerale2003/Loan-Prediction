# Loan Prediction

🏦 Loan Prediction System
📌 Project Overview

The Loan Prediction System is a Machine Learning project that predicts whether a loan application should be approved or rejected based on applicant details. The model analyzes various factors such as income, credit history, employment status, loan amount, and other financial attributes to make accurate predictions.

This project helps financial institutions automate loan approval decisions and reduce manual effort while improving accuracy and consistency.
